# Basic MOdel of a Computer

- don't always need to be write; explore all possibilities, even if they might
  be wrong
## CPU
- CPU executes __instructions__
    - must know where to find these instructions
    - executes, then finds the next instruction
- instructions modify memory
- I/O

## Program
- sequence of __instructions__

## Memory
- using actual memory locations is difficult
    - instead, use variables
    - types
- how do we access memory while programming? What if we want to manage it?

```c
int n = 5;
int *pn; // declaring an INT pointer

pn = &n // "address-of" operator. Can only be preformed on a non-pointer type (?)

// dereference on lhs 
*pn = 20 // means we say: "get the memory at pn at overwrite with this data"

// dereference on rhs
int x = *pn // gets the value in memory at the address

*pn // dereferencing a pointer, or accessing its data. can only be preformed on a pointer.
```

__Q:__ Pointers to pointers?

What is the type of this "pointer"? Answer: it is dependent on the type of the
original value. In the case of the int, we have an `int pointer`
