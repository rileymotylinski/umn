## 6.1 Declaring an array

```c
float f[4];  // Declare an array of 4 floats

f[0] = 3.14159;  // Indexing starts at 0, of course.
f[1] = 1.41421;
f[2] = 1.61803;
f[3] = 2.71828;
```
pretty simple stuff, I would say.

## 6.2 Getting the Length of an Array

Kind of impossible; you have to keep the length of the array in a separate
variable, to put it plainly.

A trick exists where you dived the `sizeof` the array by the `sizeof` the
elements, but this only works when you are int the same scope to which the array
was declared (because of pointer stuff and such), so mind as well just declare a separate variable at that point.

On another note, `sizeof` can be useful if you want to get the potential size of an array without having to initialize it:
```c
sizeof(double [48])
```

## 6.3 Array Initializers
nice and simple:
```c
int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5}; // can't have more elements than size, but can have fewer
int arr[5] = [[2]=3,2,1] // {0,0,3,2,1}
```
don't actually need the size; c can infer the size.
