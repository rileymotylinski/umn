# 5.1 Memory & Variables
__pointer__ - a variable that holds an address. Indices for memory

In memory, you could store something like integer or a float, or _an address to another "thing"_. Rarely does this number matter, but rather thing of it as simply an index in mmeory.

# 5.2 Pointer Types
```c
    int i;  // i's type is "int"
    int *p; // p's type is "pointer to an int", or "int-pointer"
```
`p`'s declaration says it _can_ point to another `int`, meaning, later, we could do this:

```c
p = &i;
```

# 5.3 Dereferencing
> rarely will the word "reference" be used in c [^1]

the pointer type declaration `*` is __NOT__ the same thing as the dereference operator `*`. Continuing our example from earlier:

```c
i = 10;  // i is now 10
*p = 20; // the thing p points to (namely i!) is now 20!!

printf("i is %d\n", i);   // prints "20"
printf("i is %d\n", *p);  // "20"! dereference-p is the same as i!
```
by _dereferencing_ `p` in the second line, you are "editing" (changing) `i` to some other value in memory [^2].

## Questions
1. How are these web pages written? I like the format a lot.
2. How is a pointer type differentiated from an int? Why can we just always define a pointer as an integer? Somehow related to the memory address...
3. [^1] What is the difference between a reference and a pointer?
4. [^2] So what if, instead, we had just set `p=20` what does that mean? DOes that change the place in memory `p` is pointing towards?
