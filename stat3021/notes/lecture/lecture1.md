__Statistics__ - collecting/organizing/interpreting/concluding based on observed data
- observed number from sample (out of a 3k Americans, how many voted for x?)
__Population__ - collection of individual units of interest
__Parameter__ - figure of a population
    - because of the arbitrary size of a population, the parameter is typically unknown
    - real/true value from the population (how many Americans voted for x?)
__Sample__ - subset of a population

Descriptive (describe a population) vs. inferential statistics (make an inference about a population)
