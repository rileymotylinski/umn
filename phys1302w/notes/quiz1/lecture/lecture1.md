- opposite charges repel, etc.
- _e_ = _-1.6*10^-19_
- Conductors (charge is free to move) vs. insulators (charges can't move)
    - semi conductors
- because a charge can't be described in fundamental units - m, kg, s - a new united is invented, a _Coloumb_.
- Superposition, or the ability to add the electrical charges to find the total force on the object
