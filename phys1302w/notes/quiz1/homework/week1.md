# Week 1 Homework

1) What is this testing?
2) Solve
3) reflect:
- Trigger words to recognize this on an exam
- Common mistake to avoid
- Shortcut or pattern

## Question 1
1) Coulombs Law; net force
2) Pretty easy, solving for some variables. Make sure to setup net forces correctly
3) Definitely be wary of the signs on your calculator and all the exponents etc.

## Question 2
1) Coulombs law; ratios
2) Just solving for F_2 / F_1 
3)__1/2 the  net charge between the two balls charge flows from one particle -> the other__

## Question 3
1) superposition?
2) Really hard calculations involving lots of vectors
3) probably should go to office hours/physics ta thing to get this answered

## Question 4

## Question 5
1) Coulombs lawl conversion of charge -> Electrons
2) draw a picture
3) forgot to convert cm correctly

## Question 6
1) Charge of a proton 1.607*10^-19
2) dimensional analysis
3) forgot to divide by molar mass

## Question 7
1) Centripetal force; coulombs law
2) setting F_c = F_e
3) Forces must be __attractive__ to create centripetal force. Because the
   original force was positive, the inner force must be negative
