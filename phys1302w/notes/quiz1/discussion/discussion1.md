# Week 1 Discussion


1) What is this testing?
2) Solve
3) reflect:
- Trigger words to recognize this on an exam
- Common mistake to avoid
- Shortcut or pattern

## Problem 1
1) Coulombs law; charge of a proton/ Newtons gravitational laws
2) Just plugging in some numbers into each formula
3) Make sure to square the bottom term in both the gravitational and electrical force formula

## Problem 2
1) Coulombs law; some trig. FBD's w/ electri al forces. Converting charge -> # of electrons
2) setup up triangle for after; assume no height difference? (small angle theorem?)
3) Drawing fbd helped a lot in recognizing that a stationary object has equal forces. $e = 1.6*10^-19C$

## Problem 3
1) SUperposition; Coulombs law; finding unit vectors 
2) Basically plugged in numbers
3) Vector in electrical force formula is normalized/unit to preserve the magnitude.
